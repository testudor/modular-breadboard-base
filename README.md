> **Warning** There will be an updated version of the breadboard base in the near future, which can either be machined from plastic or 3D printed. I plan to use threaded inserts, which will likely require slight adjustments to the mounting hole area. This would also mean that the keep-out zone for the PCBs will change slightly.

# Modular Breadboard

This is the main repository for the modular breadboard project and it also contains the 3D files for all available breadboard bases.

I decided to start this project because I wasn't happy with the quality of existing breadboard/banana-jack combinations and it kinda escalated from there.

# Modules

## Banana Bread

- Simple banana jack to female header adapter module
- Handles up to 24A in and 3A per pin out
- Supports both 'normal' banana jacks as well as the 'safety' type with an isolation sleeve
- For more info, click [here](https://github.com/testudor/banana-bread)

## Serial Bread

- USB-to-UART converter
- Robust USB-C connector
- Switchable logic levels via jumper
- Provides up to 3A@5v and 600mA@3<area>.3V
- For more info, click [here](https://github.com/testudor/serial-bread)

# Bases

## 1660-1

![1660 tie-point breadboard base](./images/base%201660-1%20cnc%20small.png)

This base is meant for 1x1660/2x830 tie-point breadboards and the only one currently available
